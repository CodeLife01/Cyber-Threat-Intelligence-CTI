# Operationalizing Crown Jewels, PIR Development, and Collection Plan

### Crown Jewels for a Financial Institution

1. **Customer Personal and Financial Data**
    - **Description**: Includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial details, such as account numbers, transaction histories, and credit card information.
    - **Reason**: This data is highly valuable to attackers for identity theft, fraud, and resale on dark web markets. It is subject to strict regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) and, if compromised, could severely damage customer trust and lead to significant legal penalties.
2. **Core Banking Systems**
    - **Description**: Systems that manage essential banking functions such as account management, transaction processing, and balance calculations.
    - **Reason**: These systems are critical for daily banking operations. Any disruption could halt services, impacting the bank’s reputation and resulting in financial losses and customer dissatisfaction. They are also potential targets for ransomware attacks.
3. **Payment Processing Infrastructure**
    - **Description**: The network and systems responsible for processing credit card, wire, ACH, and other types of payment transactions.
    - **Reason**: This infrastructure is a high-value target for cybercriminals aiming to intercept transactions, commit fraud, or deploy malware to skim financial data. Securing this infrastructure is essential to prevent financial losses and maintain regulatory compliance.
4. **Trading and Investment Platforms**
    - **Description**: Platforms used for trading stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other securities.
    - **Reason**: Trading systems are integral to revenue generation in financial institutions. Any disruption or manipulation of trades could lead to significant financial losses, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm.
5. **Financial Reporting and Regulatory Data**
    - **Description**: Systems containing sensitive financial reporting information, including quarterly earnings reports and data required for regulatory compliance.
    - **Reason**: Compromise of this data could lead to insider trading, regulatory penalties, and loss of competitive advantage. Unauthorized access to financial reports could also result in loss of shareholder confidence.
6. **Email Systems and Executive Communications**
    - **Description**: Email servers and other communication channels for executives and employees, including those used to discuss proprietary strategies or financial decisions.
    - **Reason**: Executive communications contain strategic information that, if exposed, could impact market position, aid in phishing/social engineering, or lead to insider trading if intercepted.

### Primary Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) for the Financial Institution

1. **PIR 1**: What are the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) being used by cybercriminal groups targeting financial institutions to access or exfiltrate customer PII and financial data?
2. **PIR 2**: Which threat actors are targeting core banking systems, and what indicators of compromise (IOCs) are associated with their attempts to disrupt or access these systems?
3. **PIR 3**: What are the latest methods being used to compromise or manipulate payment processing infrastructure, and how can these techniques be detected early?
4. **PIR 4**: What indicators suggest that adversaries are attempting to compromise or manipulate trading and investment platforms?
5. **PIR 5**: Are there indicators of adversaries targeting financial reporting and regulatory data, and what defensive measures are most effective in mitigating this threat?
6. **PIR 6**: Are there current phishing campaigns or social engineering attempts focused on executive communications and email systems, and what protections can be implemented to prevent them?

### Collection Plan to Service the PIRs

| PIR | Data Sources | Collection Methods | Frequency | Analysis Approach | Stakeholders |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PIR 1**: TTPs targeting customer data | - Threat intelligence feeds- Dark web monitoring- SIEM logs (user behavior, DLP alerts)- Endpoint detection and response (EDR) data | - Monitor cybercrime forums for data on financial sector threats- Collect IOCs related to data exfiltration and customer data targeting- Run regular EDR and DLP scans for anomalies | Daily | - Threat actor profiling- TTP correlation with known groups | Security Operations Center (SOC)Data Protection Officer |
| **PIR 2**: Threat actors targeting core banking systems | - Network traffic analysis- Threat intel feeds- Incident reports- Vulnerability scans | - Collect indicators and profiles from intel sources targeting financial institutions- Correlate network anomalies with threat intelligence | Weekly | - IOC detection and anomaly analysis- Vulnerability prioritization | SOCIT OperationsBanking Systems Security |
| **PIR 3**: Methods targeting payment infrastructure | - Payment system logs- Threat intel feeds- Dark web and deep web monitoring- Endpoint and network monitoring | - Collect and review malware hashes and C2 indicators- Monitor for credential stuffing, replay, and payment skimming tools | Daily | - Behavior analysis for anomaly detection- Malware and IOC correlation | Payment Systems SecurityFraud Detection Team |
| **PIR 4**: Indicators of compromise in trading platforms | - User behavior analytics- Network telemetry (VPN, cloud)- Threat intel feeds- Trading platform logs | - Collect IP reputation data, TTPs related to trading fraud- Monitor behavioral anomalies on trading systems | Daily | - Anomaly detection in trading patterns- IOC comparison with known TTPs | Trading Desk SecurityFinancial Fraud Analysts |
| **PIR 5**: Adversaries targeting financial reporting | - Executive endpoint monitoring- Communication system monitoring (email security)- Threat intelligence on advanced financial threats | - Monitor for signs of financial espionage (keyloggers, spyware)- Collect TTPs specific to financial reporting | Weekly | - TTP tracking in financial espionage- IOC correlation with high-value targets | Finance SecurityCompliance and Regulatory Team |
| **PIR 6**: Phishing or social engineering targeting executives | - Email filtering and monitoring- Threat intel on phishing- Dark web monitoring for executive PII | - Identify spear-phishing and BEC techniques- Collect email IOCs (suspicious sender patterns, payloads) | Real-time | - Phishing pattern analysis- URL/IP reputation assessment | SOCExecutive Security Team |

**Conclusion:**
This process — identifying crown jewels, developing PIRs, and creating a collection plan — enables the institution to build a focused and proactive cybersecurity strategy. By zeroing in on the assets that matter most and crafting intelligence requirements around them, the institution can enhance its defenses, improve threat detection, and protect its most valuable resources from adversary threats.
