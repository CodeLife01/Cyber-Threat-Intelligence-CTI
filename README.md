## 🎯 What You Will Learn

This CTI series walks you through the core concepts and practical applications of threat intelligence, including:

- The fundamentals of **Cyber Threat Intelligence**
- Threat actor profiling using the **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain**
- Understanding adversary behavior via the **MITRE ATT&CK** and **Unified Kill Chain**
- How to identify and protect your **crown jewels**
- Creating **Primary Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)**
- Building and operationalizing a **collection plan**
- Applying the **Pyramid of Pain** to detection and response strategies
- Using **ATT&CK Navigator** for mapping and analysis

Each topic is covered in a standalone `.md` file for easy consumption and lab follow-along.
