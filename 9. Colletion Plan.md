# Collection Plan

A **collection plan** in cybersecurity is a structured framework for gathering relevant data and intelligence that aligns with an organization’s **Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)**. PIRs are high-priority intelligence goals that provide insight into potential threats, adversary activities, and vulnerabilities. The collection plan serves as the actionable roadmap that guides cybersecurity teams in acquiring, organizing, and prioritizing the necessary data to meet these intelligence goals.

### The Purpose and Role of a Collection Plan

A collection plan ensures that cybersecurity efforts are focused and aligned with organizational priorities. By detailing the sources, types of data, and collection methods, it helps security teams efficiently gather intelligence that directly supports decision-making and threat response. In supporting PIRs, a well-designed collection plan addresses critical questions related to threat actor behaviors, potential attack vectors, vulnerabilities, or indicators of compromise (IOCs) that the organization needs to monitor. This structured approach prevents wasted effort and resource misallocation by ensuring that intelligence collection is driven by specific, high-impact goals, enhancing the organization’s overall security posture.

### Supporting PIRs Through a Collection Plan

The relationship between a collection plan and PIRs is fundamental: PIRs define *what* information is crucial, and the collection plan outlines *how* to gather that information. For instance, if a PIR highlights the need to monitor specific threat actors targeting the organization’s sector, the collection plan will specify sources and methods for gathering intelligence about these actors. This might involve setting up monitoring feeds for indicators related to these threat actors, subscribing to industry threat reports, or deploying specific tools to monitor for attack techniques associated with these adversaries.

The collection plan ensures that each piece of intelligence collected is actionable and relevant to PIRs, which in turn facilitates the organization’s ability to anticipate, detect, and mitigate threats. As such, a well-executed collection plan not only addresses immediate intelligence needs but also feeds into the organization’s long-term strategic goals by building an intelligence foundation that evolves as threats and priorities shift.

### Developing a Collection Plan

The process of developing a collection plan typically involves several steps:

1. **Identify and Define PIRs**: The first step is to clearly define the Priority Intelligence Requirements. These are usually driven by the organization’s risk profile, industry-specific threats, and critical assets. Each PIR should be specific, achievable, and directly tied to the organization's strategic goals, such as protecting customer data, ensuring regulatory compliance, or guarding intellectual property.
2. **Determine Intelligence Needs and Gaps**: Based on the PIRs, the next step is to identify what specific information is required to meet these intelligence goals and any current gaps in intelligence that need to be filled. For example, if the PIR focuses on identifying emerging malware threats, the intelligence needs may include up-to-date malware signatures, threat actor behavior patterns, and details on recent malware variants.
3. **Select Data Sources**: To address the intelligence needs, select and evaluate data sources that will provide relevant, timely information. Sources can include open-source intelligence (OSINT), commercial threat intelligence feeds, security tools like SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management), honeypots, internal log data, or industry-specific sharing platforms (such as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, or ISACs). The sources chosen should be reliable, timely, and aligned with the scope of the PIRs.
4. **Define Collection Methods and Tools**: After selecting data sources, determine the methods and tools that will be used for collecting the data. This could involve setting up automated data feeds, configuring alerts for specific IOCs, or developing scripts that gather and analyze data from various endpoints. Collection methods should account for the type of data and the need for frequency or real-time updates, ensuring that intelligence is available as threats evolve.
5. **Establish Procedures for Analysis and Dissemination**: Collected data is only valuable when analyzed and shared with the right teams or stakeholders. Define processes for how data will be analyzed, validated, and turned into actionable intelligence. Clear procedures for reporting and sharing this intelligence with decision-makers, incident response teams, or security operations centers (SOCs) ensure that information flows efficiently and reaches those who need it most.
6. **Set Timelines and Review Cycles**: Cyber threats evolve constantly, so it’s crucial to establish a schedule for regularly reviewing and updating the collection plan. This includes reevaluating PIRs, identifying new intelligence needs, and validating existing data sources and tools. Regular reviews help ensure that the collection plan remains relevant and responsive to new threats or changes in the organizational environment.
7. **Monitor and Adjust**: A collection plan must be adaptable. By monitoring the quality and relevance of the collected data against PIRs, the plan can be refined to address any shortcomings. Continuous feedback from security teams can reveal gaps or new intelligence needs, enabling the collection plan to evolve in line with threat landscapes and organizational priorities.

### Conclusion

In summary, a collection plan is an essential component of a robust cybersecurity strategy, providing structure and direction for intelligence gathering that aligns with Priority Intelligence Requirements. By specifying the *how* behind the *what* of intelligence needs, the collection plan ensures that cybersecurity teams focus their efforts on gathering relevant, actionable intelligence. This not only enhances the organization’s capability to respond to threats but also strengthens its strategic defenses against evolving cyber threats.
