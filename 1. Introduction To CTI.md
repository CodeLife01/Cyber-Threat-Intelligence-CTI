# Introduction to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

## Introduction

Threat intelligence is data that is collected, processed, and analyzed to understand a threat actor’s motives, targets, and methods. This information enables security operations teams to proactively defend against potential threats, enhancing their capacity to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents more effectively. Threat intelligence focuses on staying up-to-date with the latest threats and risks. It enables faster, data-driven security decisions, shifting security practices from reactive to proactive. This intelligence benefits all cybersecurity roles, including SOC analysts, intel analysts, and CISOs. By collecting and analyzing threat intelligence, organizations gain advantages such as early threat detection and prevention, informed decision-making with added context, improved incident response, insights into attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and strengthened defenses against evolving threats.

## The Intelligence Cycle

The intelligence cycle is a systematic, iterative process used in cyber threat intelligence (and other intelligence fields) to collect, process, analyze, and disseminate information for decision-making. The cycle ensures that intelligence efforts are focused, organized, and aligned with the needs of an organization or mission. The phases of the intelligence cycle are as follows:

---

### 1. **Requirements**

The cycle begins with defining the intelligence requirements, which are questions or needs identified by stakeholders (such as security teams, executives, or other departments) that guide the intelligence-gathering process.

- **Purpose**: To clarify what information is needed, why it is necessary, and how it will be used.
- **Process**: Analysts work with stakeholders to establish Primary Intelligence Requirements (PIRs), which prioritize specific areas of interest. This phase ensures that intelligence resources focus on issues that align with the organization’s strategic goals.
- **Outcome**: A clear set of intelligence objectives that define the scope and focus for the following phases of the cycle.

---

### 2. **Collection**

This phase involves gathering the necessary data from various sources to meet the defined intelligence requirements.

- **Purpose**: To acquire relevant, timely, and accurate information that can address the intelligence needs.
- **Process**: Analysts select sources based on their relevance to the PIRs. Sources can include open-source intelligence (OSINT), internal logs, commercial threat intelligence feeds, dark web data, network traffic analysis, and human intelligence (HUMINT). Data is gathered systematically, using tools, sensors, and feeds designed for efficient collection.
- **Outcome**: A set of raw data that serves as the input for processing and analysis, directly related to the intelligence questions established in the first phase.

---

### 3. **Processing and Exploitation**

In this phase, raw data is organized, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.

- **Purpose**: To structure and refine data, making it usable and meaningful for further examination.
- **Process**: Data is filtered, categorized, and standardized. This may involve parsing logs, removing duplicates, enriching data with context, and transforming it into formats that support analysis, such as structured databases or visual representations.
- **Outcome**: Processed data that is accurate, organized, and ready for analysis. This step eliminates noise and irrelevant information, allowing analysts to focus on the most critical data points.

---

### 4. **Analysis and Production**

This is the phase where insights are developed, and meaningful intelligence is extracted from the processed data.

- **Purpose**: To interpret the data, identify patterns, and generate actionable insights that can inform decision-making.
- **Process**: Analysts review the processed data to draw conclusions about potential threats, attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), motivations, and risks. This phase may involve pattern recognition, behavioral analysis, and the application of analytical frameworks to identify trends and forecast future threat activity. Analysts may also correlate current data with historical information to uncover deeper insights.
- **Outcome**: Intelligence reports, threat assessments, and alerts tailored to the organization’s needs. These products answer the original intelligence requirements and provide recommendations or actions based on the analysis.

---

### 5. **Dissemination**

In this phase, the intelligence products are delivered to the relevant stakeholders.

- **Purpose**: To ensure that the right people receive the intelligence in a timely manner, enabling informed decision-making.
- **Process**: Reports, briefings, and alerts are distributed according to each stakeholder’s role and level of responsibility. Dissemination can occur through various channels, including emails, dashboards, security alerts, and formal presentations.
- **Outcome**: Intelligence reaches the appropriate decision-makers and is presented in a way that is clear, relevant, and actionable. The information is tailored to each audience’s needs, whether it’s an executive summary for senior management or technical details for the SOC team.

---

### 6. **Feedback and Evaluation**

The cycle ends with feedback from stakeholders and an evaluation of the intelligence cycle’s effectiveness, which informs future cycles.

- **Purpose**: To assess whether the intelligence met the stakeholders’ needs and to identify areas for improvement in the intelligence process.
- **Process**: Stakeholders provide input on the relevance, accuracy, and usefulness of the intelligence, and analysts evaluate what went well and what could be refined. The intelligence requirements may also be updated based on new insights, changing the focus for the next cycle.
- **Outcome**: Improved intelligence processes and adjustments to future intelligence requirements, creating a continuous loop that enhances the organization’s overall intelligence capabilities.

---

### Summary of the Intelligence Cycle

The intelligence cycle is a structured, repeatable process that drives continuous improvement in intelligence operations. Here’s how each phase contributes:

1. **Requirements**: Defines the focus of intelligence-gathering efforts.
2. **Collection**: Gathers raw data from a variety of sources.
3. **Processing and Exploitation**: Organizes and cleans data for analysis.
4. **Analysis and Production**: Interprets data to produce actionable insights.
5. **Dissemination**: Delivers intelligence to stakeholders for informed decision-making.
6. **Feedback and Evaluation**: Ensures continuous improvement and relevance.

The cycle is iterative, meaning that feedback from one cycle informs the next. This allows an organization to respond to evolving threats and continuously refine its intelligence efforts. By following the intelligence cycle, organizations can stay proactive, informed, and prepared to address potential threats effectively.

## **Types of Threat Intelligence**

In the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, organizations aiming to strengthen their defenses must stay ahead of emerging risks and leverage threat intelligence. Threat intelligence typically falls into three categories: tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence. By incorporating these types, organizations can track shifts in threat actor strategies over time and effectively plan defenses to counter dynamic cyber threats.

### Tactical Intelligence

- **Focus**: Immediate future; technical in nature.
- **Purpose**: Identifies simple indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domains, and file hashes.
- **Sources**: IOCs can be collected during investigations, threat-hunting, or malware analyses and through open-source feeds like:
    - AlienVault OTX
    - Abuse.ch
    - Blocklist.de
    - Proofpoint Emerging Threats
- **Usage**: Consumed by IT and SOC analysts.
- **Lifespan**: Short-lived, as IOCs like malicious IPs or domains may become obsolete in hours or days.

### Operational Intelligence

- **Focus**: The “who,” “why,” and “how” of cyber attacks.
- **Purpose**: Provides insights into adversaries’ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to understand attacker motives, identification, and methods.
- **Benefits**: Enables the security operations team to anticipate and counter how adversaries conduct campaigns and major operations.
- **Lifespan**: Longer-lasting than tactical intelligence, enhanced through human analysis.

### Strategic Intelligence

- **Focus**: Long-term planning and decision-making.
- **Purpose**: Helps senior decision-makers understand cybersecurity risks to inform investment and policy decisions.
- **Usage**: Targeted toward CISOs and executive management.
- **Collection**: Requires in-depth analysis of cybersecurity trends and geopolitics, typically presented in detailed reports.

**Benefits of Combining Threat Intelligence Types**

Integrating tactical, operational, and strategic intelligence helps organizations build robust, adaptive cyber defenses to address a broad range of threats. This layered approach enhances detection, response, and preventive strategies against cyber adversaries.

## **SOC Analysts and Threat Intelligence**

SOC analysts utilize tactical and operational intelligence to stay informed about the latest threats, attack methods, threat actors, and vulnerabilities. Here are the practical steps SOC analysts take to leverage threat intelligence:

### 1. Gathering Observables

- **Observables**: Pieces of potential threat data, such as IP addresses, domain names, URLs, file hashes, email addresses, etc.
- **Sources**: Collected through SIEM, EDR, email security tools, and open-source threat intelligence feeds.

### 2. Enrichment and Context

- **Process**: Once observables are identified, analysts enrich them with context to understand the potential threat.
- **Example**: A suspicious IP (123.45.67.89) connecting to a newly registered domain (malicious-website.com) is investigated. The IP is linked to prior phishing campaigns, and the domain is hosted in a high-risk area for cybercriminal activity.

### 3. IOC Creation

- **Goal**: Create Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) based on enriched data for future detection.
- **Example IOCs**:
    - IP address IOC: 123.45.67.89
    - Domain IOC: malicious-website.com
    - URL path IOC: malicious-website.com/login
- **Implementation**: IOCs are added to security tools (e.g., firewalls, IDS, SIEM). Matches indicate potential threats that require investigation.

### 4. Detection and Response

- **Monitoring**: Security systems actively monitor traffic and logs for IOC matches.
- **Response**: If a match is detected, an alert triggers incident response.
- **Example**: A user accesses the IOC URL path, triggering an IDS alert. The SOC team investigates, isolates the compromised system, and initiates containment and malware analysis to prevent further spread.

### 5. Continuous Improvement

- **Post-Incident Analysis**: After resolution, the SOC team evaluates the response process to refine IOCs and enhance future detection.
- **Example**: Identifying that a phishing email contained a fake job offer prompt, the SOC team adds relevant subject patterns to IOCs for better detection of similar threats.

**Sources of Threat Intelligence**

“Where does all this data come from? Threat intelligence is gathered from a variety of sources, including:

1. **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Publicly available sources like security blogs, forums, and feeds such as AlienVault OTX, Abuse.ch, and Proofpoint Emerging Threats.
2. **Commercial Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Paid sources that provide detailed, verified data on current and emerging threats.
3. **Internal Data**: Logs, incident reports, and alerts within an organization that reveal attack patterns and vulnerabilities.
4. **Information Sharing Partnerships**: Many sectors, like finance and healthcare, have information-sharing partnerships that provide insights into sector-specific threats.

By gathering data from multiple sources, organizations can build a well-rounded view of the threat landscape.”

**Benefits of Threat Intelligence**

“So why invest in threat intelligence? Here are a few key benefits:

1. **Early Detection**: Threat intelligence helps security teams identify and block threats early, reducing the likelihood of a successful attack.
2. **Informed Decision-Making**: By understanding attacker methods, security leaders can make data-backed decisions, investing in the right tools and strategies.
3. **Improved Incident Response**: With better intelligence, SOC teams can respond faster and more accurately, minimizing the impact of security incidents.
4. **Enhanced Understanding of TTPs**: Knowing the tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors helps organizations anticipate and defend against specific attack methods.
5. **Proactive Defense**: Instead of waiting for an attack, organizations can actively monitor for potential threats and prevent incidents before they happen.”

“Threat intelligence not only helps organizations stay safe but also strengthens the entire cybersecurity ecosystem by enabling informed, proactive security strategies.”

**Practical Example**

“Let’s consider a practical example: Suppose a SOC team receives threat intelligence indicating that a phishing campaign is targeting organizations in their industry.

- **Step 1**: They gather observables, such as malicious IP addresses and URLs associated with the campaign.
- **Step 2**: They enrich this data, finding that the campaign is linked to a known threat actor.
- **Step 3**: IOCs are created and added to their security tools.
- **Step 4**: When an employee receives a phishing email with the same indicators, the security system detects the threat and alerts the SOC team.
- **Step 5**: The SOC team isolates the affected device and begins an investigation to prevent further damage.”

“This is a simple example, but it demonstrates how threat intelligence enables proactive defense and swift response to emerging threats.”
