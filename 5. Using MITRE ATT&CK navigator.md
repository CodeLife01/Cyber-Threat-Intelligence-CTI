## **Using MITRE ATT&CK Navigator for Analyzing FIN Threat Actors**

The **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** is an invaluable tool for security professionals, offering a way to visualize and work with adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to assess security controls and identify gaps. One practical use case of ATT&CK Navigator is mapping out threat actors’ techniques. In this example, we will focus on the “FIN” threat actors—to gain insights into their behaviors, prioritize defense strategies, and improve threat detection.

The **FIN threat actors** are a group of financially motivated cybercriminal organizations that target various industries, primarily financial services, to steal sensitive data, commit fraud, or deploy ransomware. These groups, including well-known actors like **FIN7**, **FIN8**, and **FIN10**, use advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to infiltrate organizations and evade detection. Known for their sophisticated and often highly targeted attack methods, FIN threat actors leverage tactics such as spear phishing, point-of-sale (POS) malware, credential theft, and persistence techniques. Their operations are marked by adaptability and innovation, frequently updating tools and techniques to bypass security measures, making them a significant and persistent threat to organizations worldwide

### Step-by-Step Workflow: Mapping FIN Threat Actors

### Step 1: Access ATT&CK Navigator and Understand the Layout

To begin, access ATT&CK Navigator via [MITRE’s online instance](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise/) or download it from the [MITRE ATT&CK GitHub repository](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator) to run locally. The default view shows the matrix of tactics and techniques: tactics (the columns) represent adversary goals or the "why" (e.g., Initial Access, Execution), while techniques (cells under each tactic) describe the "how," or the specific methods used to achieve each tactic.

### Step 2: Create Layers for Each FIN Threat Actor

Start by identifying each FIN threat actor you want to investigate, such as FIN7, FIN8, FIN10, etc. For each threat actor, create an individual layer in Navigator.

1. **Create a New Layer for Each Threat Actor**:
    - Go to **File > New Blank Layer**.
    - Name each layer according to the threat actor it represents (e.g., “FIN7 Techniques”).
    - Select the **Enterprise** domain if working with enterprise-related techniques.
    - In the layer, use ATT&CK’s resources or intelligence sources to map the techniques specific to that FIN actor. Highlight each relevant technique that the threat actor is known to use by selecting it in the matrix.
2. **Apply Color Coding for Visual Clarity**:
    - For each technique used by the threat actor, apply a color that reflects the threat level or significance based on your organization’s criteria, using a green-to-red color gradient.
        - **Green**: Represents low-priority or low-risk techniques (e.g., rarely used or low-impact techniques).
        - **Yellow**: Medium priority, highlighting commonly used techniques that require moderate attention.
        - **Red**: High priority, indicating techniques that are frequently used or highly impactful.

### Step 3: Annotate and Score Techniques for Each Layer

After color-coding each technique, add **annotations** and **scores** to provide context and prioritize your responses. For example, techniques with higher scores indicate higher risk or operational importance, helping to structure a response based on impact level.

- **Add Comments**: Document threat intelligence details about each technique (e.g., specific tactics the actor uses or intelligence sources). Comments can provide context for other analysts.
- **Assign Scores**: Use scores to quantify technique priority (e.g., score “10” for high-risk techniques).

### Step 4: Combine Individual FIN Actor Layers into a New Aggregated Layer

With individual layers complete, combine these into a single, comprehensive layer for an overview of all FIN threat actors’ techniques. This merged layer will reveal overlaps between threat actors, helping to highlight common techniques and prioritize defenses against tactics likely to be encountered.

1. **Layer Stacking**:
    - Go to **Layer Controls > Add Layer** and stack each individual FIN layer on top of one another.
    - Select the option to **Combine Layers** and assign the resulting layer a new name, such as “Combined FIN Threat Actors.”
2. **Set Up Aggregate Color Coding**:
    - Use the green-to-red gradient to represent the frequency and severity of techniques across all FIN threat actors:
        - Techniques that only appear in one FIN layer can remain green.
        - Techniques present in multiple layers should be gradually shifted to yellow or red based on the number of occurrences, indicating higher risk or relevance.
    - By adjusting the color gradient, your team can quickly identify techniques that multiple FIN actors use, warranting additional attention in your defense strategy.

### Step 5: Interpret Results and Use the Combined Layer for Defense Prioritization

The combined layer offers a consolidated view of all FIN threat actors’ TTPs, allowing you to assess and refine your security posture:

- **Identify High-Risk Techniques**: Techniques that multiple FIN threat actors employ will stand out in red, providing a clear starting point for enhancing detection and defense strategies.
- **Highlight Gaps in Coverage**: Use the combined layer to identify any techniques not currently covered by existing security controls, allowing for focused improvements.
- **Enhance Collaboration and Reporting**: Export the combined layer to share with your security teams or stakeholders. Options like JSON, Excel, or image format (SVG) make it easy to present findings and collaborate on mitigation actions.

### Practical Application: Incorporating the Combined FIN Layer into Your Security Strategy

With the combined FIN layer in hand, you can effectively prioritize defenses against shared tactics and techniques:

1. **Gap Analysis for Defense Planning**:
    - Review red-highlighted techniques that span multiple FIN actors, identifying gaps where your defenses need enhancement.
2. **Threat Hunting**:
    - Use high-priority techniques to direct threat-hunting activities, focusing efforts on adversary techniques your organization is most likely to face.
3. **Incident Response Preparation**:
    - Map out real-world attack scenarios for incident response, using the combined layer to simulate FIN actors’ attack chains from initial access to exfiltration.
4. **Red and Blue Team Collaboration**:
    - Red teams can build attack scenarios based on the FIN layer, while blue teams map out defense mechanisms for each identified technique, fostering alignment on realistic threats.

### Conclusion

MITRE ATT&CK Navigator provides a versatile platform for mapping and visualizing the TTPs of threat actors, such as the FIN group. By creating individual layers for each FIN threat actor and combining them into an aggregated layer with a color-coded gradient, security teams can quickly identify high-priority techniques and make informed decisions about defense strategies. This approach facilitates more effective gap analysis, targeted threat hunting, and enhanced security collaboration, ultimately helping organizations improve their resilience against sophisticated threat actors like those in the FIN group.
